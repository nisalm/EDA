# Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis

1. ## Qualitative Analysis**

   Qualitative analysis focuses on understanding the non-numerical attributes of the data. It emphasizes exploring the structure, patterns, relationships, and trends in categorical or descriptive data.

Key Features:
- Deals with categorical or textual data.
- Involves visualizations and summary descriptions to identify relationships and distributions.
- Provides insights into the qualitative nature of the dataset.

1. Distribution of Categories:

Analyzing the frequency of unique values in categorical columns (e.g., gender, product categories).
```python
data['Gender'].value_counts()
```

2. Identifying Relationships:

Checking how categorical features relate to the target variable (e.g., survival rate by gender in the Titanic dataset).
```python
data.groupby('Gender')['Survived'].mean()
```
3. Visualizing Patterns:

Using bar plots, pie charts, or heatmaps to represent categorical relationships.
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.countplot(x='Gender', hue='Survived', data=data)
```

2. ## Quantitative Analysis**
Quantitative analysis focuses on exploring and summarizing numerical attributes of the data. It involves mathematical and statistical techniques to derive insights from the numbers.

Key Features:
- Deals with numerical data (e.g., age, salary, sales).
- Includes summary statistics, distributions, and advanced mathematical techniques.
- Provides precise and measurable insights.

1. Summary Statistics:

Computing measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles to describe numerical columns.  
```python
data['Age'].describe()
```

2. Outlier Detection:

Identifying extreme values in numerical data using box plots or interquartile range (IQR).
```python
sns.boxplot(x=data['Age'])
```

3. Correlation Analysis:

Calculating correlation coefficients to measure the strength of relationships between numerical variables.
```python
data.corr()
```
4. Visualizing Distributions:

Using histograms, scatter plots, or density plots to understand data spread and relationships.

```python
sns.histplot(data['Age'], bins=20)
sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='Fare', data=data)

```
