# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining, summarizing, and visualizing data to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions before applying machine learning models. It involves:

1. Understanding Data: Identifying data types (categorical, numerical), shapes, and distributions.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. Visualizing Data: Using plots and graphs (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand relationships and distributions.
4. Summarizing Data: Generating descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

Tools: Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are commonly used for EDA.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was introduced by John W. Tukey, an American mathematician and statistician, in his seminal book "Exploratory Data Analysis," published in 1977.
