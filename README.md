# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining, summarizing, and visualizing data to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions before applying machine learning models. It involves:

1. **Understanding Data:** Identifying data types (categorical, numerical), shapes, and distributions.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. **Visualizing Data:** Using plots and graphs (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand relationships and distributions.
4. **Summarizing Data:** Generating descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

**Tools:** Python libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) are commonly used for EDA. However you also can use low-code_no-code tools like [Microsoft Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) to perform EDA without writing codes. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was introduced by John W. Tukey, an American mathematician and statistician, in his seminal book **Exploratory Data Analysis,** published in 1977.

### Tukey's Contributions
- Developed several statistical methods, such as the box plot and stem-and-leaf plot, which are widely used in EDA.
- Co-developed the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in computer science.

## Why EDA is Important for AI  

- **Understanding the Data:** AI models rely on data for training. EDA helps to understand the structure, distribution, and quality of the data, ensuring the data is suitable for the problem.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifies important features and relationships in the data that can improve model performance.
Guides feature transformations, such as scaling or encoding categorical variables.
- **Detecting and Handling Anomalies:** Helps identify missing data, outliers, or inconsistent values that can negatively impact AI models.
Ensures data quality before proceeding with modeling.
- **Visual Insights:** Visualization can reveal hidden patterns (e.g., correlations, trends) that might not be obvious from raw data.
Helps in hypothesis formulation and testing.
- **Reduces Bias:** Identifies imbalanced datasets (e.g., class imbalance in classification tasks) that could lead to biased models.
Informs resampling or weighting strategies.
- **Avoids Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO):** Poor-quality or misunderstood data leads to inaccurate AI predictions.
EDA acts as the quality checkpoint to ensure meaningful results.
- **Guides Model Selection:** Insights from EDA, such as the linearity of relationships, can influence the choice of algorithms (e.g., linear regression vs. tree-based methods).
- **Saves Time:** Detecting issues early prevents wasted time on building models with flawed data.
Helps prioritize areas of focus before complex modeling.
- **Builds Intuition:** For AI practitioners, EDA builds intuition about the data and problem space, aiding better decision-making during model development.
